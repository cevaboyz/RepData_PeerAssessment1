## RepData_PeerAssignment on knitr 
======================================

This first chunk of code is simply a function to download the dataset for the
assignment, store it in a temporary file, unzip and read it into the variable 
data, then it proceeds to delete the temporary vector containing the file


```{r}

temp <- tempfile()

download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip", temp)

data <- read.csv(unz(temp, "activity.csv"))

unlink(temp)

```

The second chunk of code is going to transform and tidy up the dataset for the 
next steps:

1. Transform the date column from character class to date class with the package
lubridate and the function ymd()


```{r}

require(lubridate)

data$date <- ymd(data$date)
